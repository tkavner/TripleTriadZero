>> import ttnnbot4
>> bot = ttnnbot4.TripleTriadBot(44)
>> bot.playAgainstBot()

To play against older versions of the network use (note that not all versions are included in this repository):

>> bot = ttnnbot3.TripleTriadBot(n)
>> bot.playAgainstBot()

Where n is the older version. To replay the network:

>> bot.playAgainstBot()
